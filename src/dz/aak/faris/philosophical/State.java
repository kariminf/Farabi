/**
 * Having or state, condition (ἔχειν, echein, to have or be). 
 * The examples Aristotle gives indicate that he meant a condition of rest resulting 
 * from an affection (i.e. being acted on): ‘shod’, ‘armed’. The term is, however, 
 * frequently taken to mean the determination arising from the physical accoutrements 
 * of an object: one's shoes, one's arms, etc. Traditionally, this category is also 
 * called a habitus (from Latin habere, to have).
