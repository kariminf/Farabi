 * Quantity (ποσόν, poson, how much). This is the extension of an object, and may be 
 * either discrete or continuous. Further, its parts may or may not have relative 
 * positions to each other. All medieval discussions about the nature of the continuum, 
 * of the infinite and the infinitely divisible, are a long footnote to this text. 
 * It is of great importance in the development of mathematical ideas in the medieval 
 * and late Scholastic period. Examples: two cubits long, number, space, (length of) time.
